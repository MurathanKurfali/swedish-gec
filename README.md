# MT-based Distantly Supervised Grammatical Error Correction for Swedish

This repository contains the source code and the models used for [Shared task on Multilingual Grammatical Error Detection (MultiGED-2023)](https://github.com/spraakbanken/multiged-2023). The system utilizes a neural machine translation-based model trained on an automatically corrupted large corpus of Swedish text (~3.2 billion words).

The model is intended as a baseline for our ongoing work on Swedish grammatical error correction using large language models (Ã–stling&Kurfali, 2022). The shared task results suggest that our model is conservative yet remarkably precise in its predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- SentencePiece
- OpenNMT==2.3.0

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/grammatical-error-detection-swedish.git

2. Download the model from ["Google Drive"](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VEtTYgtrW9WRJw0Owp8aQl_nADcwvgyr?usp=share_link).

3. Run the script to process your input:

bash correct.sh <model_path> <input_file> <output_directory>

- `<model_path>`: Path to the pre-trained model file.
- `<input_file>`: Path to the input file to be processed.
- `<output_directory>`: Path to the directory where the output files will be saved.

The input file should follow the "one sentence per line" format.
